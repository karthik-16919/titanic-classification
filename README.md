# titanic-classification
The Titanic classification problem is a popular machine learning task that involves predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on certain features of the passengers. It is commonly used as an introductory problem for learning data science and machine learning concepts.
**Problem Statement Overview**
Objective: Develop a predictive system that determines the likelihood of a passenger surviving the Titanic disaster based on their characteristics and circumstances. Additionally, the system should analyze and identify the most influential factors that contributed to a passengerâ€™s survival.
**Desired Outcomes**
Survival Prediction Model: A machine learning model that accurately predicts the survival of passengers based on the input features.
Analysis of Influential Factors: The model should provide insights into which features (socio-economic status, age, gender, etc.) were most crucial in determining survival. This could be done through methods like feature importance analysis in a Random Forest model or examining coefficients in a Logistic Regression model.
